### Winter/Spring 2024 theme: Words That Smooth The Way

[Download the flyer [PDF]](/pdf/writing-workshops-jan-mar-2024.pdf)

What better way to begin a new year than by celebrating those small yet vital words that smooth the way in our everyday interactions and relationships? This new series of workshops offers an opportunity to explore through writing just how we use these words, their place and purpose in our language and our lives. There’ll be a range of prompts, with plenty of space and time to write, and the chance to share if you wish to. No writing talent or experience is needed and you can be sure of a warm welcome in this relaxed and supportive group.
