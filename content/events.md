The workshops I offer focus on the writing process and provide a space for people from all walks of life to discover the joy and therapeutic potential of creative writing. During current restrictions that space is inevitably online, but our Zoom sessions have increased accessibility and are proving very popular.

## Writing for Wellbeing in Westcott

### Spring/summer 2022 Theme: Colour

[Download the flyer [PDF]](/pdf/writing-workshops-may-jul-2022.pdf)

As spring brings fresh life and colour to the natural world, our theme for this series of workshops will be colour. We’ll be focusing on the three colours of our national flag (with a nod to the upcoming jubilee celebrations). In our writing, we will consider where these colours are found and how they are used, as well as exploring the associations they hold and the emotions they evoke. As always, there’ll be time and space to write, reflect and share.
