The workshops I offer focus on the writing process and provide a space for people from all walks of life to discover the joy and therapeutic potential of creative writing. During current restrictions that space is inevitably online, but our Zoom sessions have increased accessibility and are proving very popular.

## Writing for Wellbeing in Westcott

### Winter 2022 Theme: _Maps_

[Download the flyer [PDF]](/pdf/writing-workshops-jan-mar-2022.pdf)

As we begin to navigate another year with all its possibilities, we’ll be taking maps as our writing focus in this next series of workshops. Whether digital or in concrete form, maps can help us to orientate ourselves, connect with our surroundings, locate a destination and find our direction. Hopefully they will also offer us many and varied writing prompts! As always, there’ll be time and space to write, reflect and share.
