I’ve taught English and Creative Writing for many years but now, as a facilitator, I create spaces in which people can discover the power of writing to enhance wellbeing and promote self-development, both personally and professionally.

Alongside this, I write poetry for the pleasure (and pain) of it, and because sometimes it resonates with those who care to read or listen.
