To hug or not to hug, no question.

To stay indoors or venture forth\\
to share or take your own\\
to wear a mask or go bare-faced\\
to anti-bac the packets or not care\\
to wash your hands again or let it wait\\
to join with video or just be heard\\
to call a friend or soldier on alone\\
to get a test or label it a cold\\
to force a smile or let the shadows show\\
to wash your hands again or let it wait\\
to check the news or put the world on hold\\
to send her back to school or keep her close\\
to book a break or leave it till next year\\
to plan ahead or say today’s enough\\
to wash your hands again or let it wait\\
to set reverse or forge a better path\\
to settle for despair or lunge for hope\\
to stare into the mud or gaze at stars\\
to wash your hands again or let it wait
