The workshops I offer focus on the writing process and provide a space for people from all walks of life to discover the joy and therapeutic potential of creative writing. During current restrictions that space is inevitably online, but our Zoom sessions have increased accessibility and are proving very popular.

## Writing for Wellbeing in Westcott

### Autumn 2022 Theme: The Quest

[Download the flyer [PDF]](/pdf/writing-workshops-sep-nov-2022.pdf)

As one season segues into another and we slowly adjust to muted skies and shorter days, we hear again the invitation to pause, reflect and write. Our workshops this autumn take up the theme of ‘The Quest’, offering an opportunity to consider the things we search for, what we find and how we choose what to keep.There’ll be time and space to write without pressure or expectations, as we allow our words to flow and lead us wherever they will.
