I write because there might be something
someone hasn’t said yet,
because there’s treasure to be kept,
because words on paper listen
and yet do not answer back
unless I ask them to,
because this language is too beautiful
to lie in dusty dictionaries,
because some things can’t be spoken.
I write to celebrate the endless possibilities,
the infinite connections.
I write because I can.
