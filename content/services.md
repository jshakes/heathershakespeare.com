- Bespoke writing programmes for specific contexts and client groups
	Designed, delivered and evaluated a 10-week journal writing programme in a women’s prison. Teamed up with a fellow practitioner to offer writing for wellbeing in the workplace. Visit our website WritingForLife.co.uk to find out more.

	Currently piloting a free online taster course, Wellbeing at Work, created in collaboration with Kate McBarron in response to the Covid-19 crisis (link?)
