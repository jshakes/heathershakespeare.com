The workshops I offer focus on the writing process and provide a space for people from all walks of life to discover the joy and therapeutic potential of creative writing. During current restrictions that space is inevitably online, but our Zoom sessions have increased accessibility and are proving very popular.

### Summer 2023 theme: The Growing Season

[Download the flyer [PDF]](/pdf/writing-workshops-may-jul-2023.pdf)

As we emerge from the dormancy of winter into the warmer and brighter months, our next series of workshops, The Growing Season, takes on a horticultural and agricultural theme. We’ll be exploring ideas around growth, from sowing and planting through to harvesting, and everything in between. As ever, there’ll be space and time to write without any expectations, to reflect on your words, wherever they take you, and to share with others if you wish. No talent required and all are most welcome to join us.
