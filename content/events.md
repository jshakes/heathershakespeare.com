### Summer 2024 theme: The Serenity Prayer

[Download the flyer [PDF]](/pdf/writing-workshops-may-jul-2024.pdf)

This summer, our writing workshops will focus on a challenge we all face every day: how to react to life’s problems, irritations and perceived imperfections. We’ll take the opening lines of Reinhold Niebuhr’s famous Serenity Prayer as our starting point and, as always, there’ll be plenty of space and time to write, and to share your words if you wish to. No writing talent or experience is needed and you can be sure of a warm welcome in this relaxed and supportive group.
