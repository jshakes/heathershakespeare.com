The workshops I offer focus on the writing process and provide a space for people from all walks of life to discover the joy and therapeutic potential of creative writing. During current restrictions that space is inevitably online, but our Zoom sessions have increased accessibility and are proving very popular.

## Writing for Wellbeing in Westcott

### Winter/Spring 2023 theme: Sweet Treats

[Download the flyer [PDF]](/pdf/writing-workshops-jan-mar-2023.pdf)

Just before we leave behind those festive treats and little indulgences, we pause to reflect on the names of some of the nation’s favourite confectionery – past and present. Our first series of workshops in 2023 will focus on ‘Sweet Treats’, but this time the calorie-free variety! There’ll be an opportunity to explore the associations these names hold and, as always, the space and time to write without pressure or expectations. All are very welcome to join us.
