[Download the flyer [PDF]](/pdf/writing-workshops-sep-nov-2023.pdf)

Join us for any or all of our workshops this autumn as we explore this ancient theme of pilgrimage and see where it leads. There’ll be a range of prompts, with plenty of space and time to write, as well as the opportunity to share your words or reflections if you wish to. No writing talent or experience is needed and you can be sure of a warm welcome in this relaxed and supportive group.
