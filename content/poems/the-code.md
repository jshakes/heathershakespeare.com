They made it very simple so\\
the smallest child could understand,\\
drilled into us the words that kept us safe\\
instilled in us the rhythm and the pace\\
_– Think – stop – wait – look – listen –_

They told us we must bide our time,\\
stand still and steady at the edge,\\
linger long enough to notice what\\
approached, take it slow and only\\
go when all was clear.

Or was it just the fear that held us\\
there, stopped us running out to court\\
disaster for a plastic ball that slipped\\
our grasp, stopped us cutting short\\
our little lives for a plaything?

And now, constrained to stop again\\
against our will, we stand and watch\\
what happens if we do not care,\\
if caught up in the game, the thrill, the win\\
we look away and fail to see what lies\\
ahead, as whoops and shouts drown out\\
the green and quiet earth’s refrain:\\
_– Think – stop – wait – look – listen –_
